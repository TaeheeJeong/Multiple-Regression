#regression diagnostic plots 

a) q-q plot
fig1=sm.qqplot(reg3.resid, line='r')
Please check "qqplot.png".

if the residuals in a Q-Q plt follow a straight line, the residuals are normally distributed.
In the qqplot, the residuals do not follow a straight line. 
There is negative deviation at begining, then, positive deviation in the middle, then, negative deviation at the end.


b) standardized residuals for all observations
stdres=pd.DataFrame(reg3.resid_pearson)
plt.plot(stdres, 'o', ls='None')
l = plt.axhline(y=0, color='r')
plt.ylabel('Standardized Residual')
plt.xlabel('Observation Number')

Please check "stdred.png".

a residual is the difference between the observed response value and the model predicted response value.
The scattered data points are remained within 2.5 standard deviation.
Some data points are located out boundary of 2 stardard deviation. 
This means that there are some outliers, but the outliers are not far away from normal distribution.

c) leverage plot
fig3=sm.graphics.influence_plot(reg3, size=8)
print(fig3)

Please check "leverage_plot.png".

A leverage plot is used to identify observations that are outliers and/or have a large influence on model estimation.
The outliers are mostly located in the higher value of explanatory variables.
