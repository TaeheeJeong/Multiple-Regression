# Multiple-Regression
week3 assignment for Regression modeling in practice

My dataset is gapminder. my response variable is life expectancy (year). my explanatory varables are alcohol consumption (liter), urban rate, and income per person. 

After adjusting for potential confounding factors, urban rate (Beta0.16, p=.0000) was significantly and positively associated with life expectancy. income (Beta0.0003, p=.0000) was also positively, but weakly associated with life expectancy. alcohol consumption was not shown the association with life expectancy (p=0.116 > 0.05).
