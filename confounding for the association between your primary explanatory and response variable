#Discuss whether or not there was evidence of confounding for the association between your primary explanatory and response variable.

In the previous analysis, alcol consumption and life expectancy shows significant positive association. 
(coefficient  0.5873, p-value is 0.000)
However, R_squared is only 0.089, which means only 9% variation of response variable is catched by explanatory variable.
When income and/or urban rate is added as explanatory variable, R_squared is increased to more than 0.35. 
This indicates that income or urban rate can be confounding variable.
